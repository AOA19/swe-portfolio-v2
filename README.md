# Software Engineer Portfolio 

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. The site showcases my skills, and latest projects. This project follows a modular structure, with reusable components for scalability. The light/dark mode is implemented using the ``useState`` hook, applying dynamic classes based on the selected theme.
